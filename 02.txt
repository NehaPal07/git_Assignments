NOTE: If you don't have a GitHub account already, you will need to create one and be logged in to GitHub in another browser tab to complete this activity.

In your efforts to better support a development organization, you have begun experimenting with Git source control and its interactions with GitHub. 
In order to be able to provide secure access to any repositories that are in use, you will create a special SSH key (separate from any that may have been 
created for other local systems to authenticate through) to be able to make an exchange with GitHub, and identify a service account called 'cloud_user' 
with your own account.

You will need to use the OpenSSH Client's utilities to create this key. First, create a subdirectory in your account's home directory called 'githubkeys'. 
Using the appropriate tool, you will create a new key (the default encryption type and size will be acceptable according to your organization's security 
policy) in this new directory called 'github-service-key'. Once you have this key, find the public key file that matches then copy and paste that into 
the appropriate account profile information in GitHub. After giving the key a reference name, you should see it appear in the list of your authorized keys, 
that will confirm it is available for use when trying to securely connect to your account.

Solution:
cd /c/Users/npal3/Desktop/Neha/Git
mkdir githubkeys
ssh-keygen
(C:\Users\npal3\.ssh)
adding ssh key to the ssh-agent
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
copy the key to github account.
and provided the name as "github-service-key"

Verify:
npal3@LIN35006529 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Neha/Git/githubkeys
$ ssh -T git@github.com
The authenticity of host 'github.com (13.234.176.102)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,13.234.176.102' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Hi NehaPal07! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
